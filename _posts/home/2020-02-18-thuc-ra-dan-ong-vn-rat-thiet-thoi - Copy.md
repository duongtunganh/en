These days, no, actually from a lot of walking, there are 1001 articles comparing western boys and Vietnamese boys online. Most of the content is criticized by Vietnamese men who are not delicate, gentle and responsible like Western men. Although married to a Western man, I could not help but laugh at those articles. What you see is actually just the surface. A long time ago, I realized one thing: Vietnamese men are extremely disadvantaged compared to Western men.

Nearly ten years ago, when I was away from home to study abroad for the first time, I enrolled with a Vietnamese boy. During the first month of living alone, he only knows how to buy ready-to-cook chicken drumsticks, cook rice and boil vegetables, so he skips it. The result is constipation. Crime 😞 (if you read it, please let me know because I brought you up here like 😅).

In Vietnamese, there is only the concept of "female family member" but not "male household member". A boy growing up has not been taught by his parents basic survival skills such as cooking, cleaning, and self-help. Then when they have to be independent, they become more embarrassed, worried and confused than any other girl. Also because at home is covered by their mother, they always need a woman to cover them in the same way. So marriage in Vietnam is almost inevitable. Men get married sometimes because they can't take care of themselves. Don't wonder why Western men love more passionately. Simply because they can live well alone, can take care of themselves, so decided to love someone, get someone merely from love, not from the need to "force it"!
Không chỉ thế, áp lực trên vai một người đàn ông Việt cũng nặng nề hơn đàn ông phương Tây rất nhiều. Người ta mong đẻ con trai bao nhiêu thì áp lực đặt lên vai đứa bé trai lại nặng trĩu bấy nhiêu. Có bao nhiêu người đàn ông Việt được lớn lên và lựa chọn cuộc sống họ thích thay vì phải gánh vác trọng trách “đích tôn của dòng họ”. Rồi chính điều đó tạo cho đàn ông tính lăng nhăng luôn. Vì sao ư? Vì bố mẹ luôn dạy rằng “học giỏi, nhiều tiền đi thì sẽ có đầy gái theo”. Ngay từ lúc còn là 1 bé trai, họ đã được giáo dục rằng đàn bà là món quà cho sự thành đạt, thì đừng có ý kiến khi lớn lên, đàn ông chỉ coi phụ nữ như một món hàng, thậm chí là một thứ đồ chơi tình dục.

Personality and culture are formed by education. No child who is destined to become a good person or a bad person. Bao Vietnamese men bad. Who is the one who teaches Vietnamese men? It is the Vietnamese woman. Women always complain about lazy husbands, girls, irresponsible. But how many mothers know how to teach their sons to respect women? How many mothers teach their son to cook, do housework and change diapers for babies? How many mothers are harsh with their sons when they are unfaithful to their partners ??? We demanded to be pampered, but if the son washed his wife a bowl, then she would struggle; demanding docile husband but his son is promiscuous, he told his daughter-in-law "take it, everyone is that"; demanding that her husband be responsible but seeing her son give money to his parents-in-law, he would grind his daughter-in-law to dig ...


This morning, a friend told me in my group that her friend gave birth to a guy who kept rubbing "I take care of him like this but later he goes to take care of another baby" while I always ask for it. husband must love himself more than his mother. It's ungainly

We Vietnamese women suffer from the disease: always feel disadvantaged, always feel sacrificed, and always feel miserable. But they don't think that Vietnamese men are disadvantaged. Women are taught too many skills to be perfect and attractive; Vietnamese men, they are taught no way to be attractive to women, except to make money. The most miserable in the world is want without knowing how.


So, if you want to live in a romantic environment with sweet men, then teach your son how to cook ...
