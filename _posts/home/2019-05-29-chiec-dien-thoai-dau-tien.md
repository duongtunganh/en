I remember Wiko Rainbow Lite was my first touchpad I bought in 7th grade.</p>

Wiko is a French phone brand emerging in our country in 2015, famous for its cheap price and still maintaining a good configuration. It belongs to the cheapest and cheapest product line among the mobile phones in the Mobile World's booth, at a price of VND 1,999,000. Of course, now for that price you can buy dozens of Chinese phones with rabbit ears, waterdrop screens, ... powerful configurations, good cameras, and so on.

At that time I hated the iPhone in general and the iOS in particular because I was still an Android Fan and I was influenced by the Android devices my parents used. My mother has used the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 so far and my father at that time used Sony Xperia J. Of course, both were running Android and I could experience and scratch it. At that time, I liked the navigation bar of Android more than the iPhone because its navigation bar was very convenient, with up to 3 buttons to navigate such as Back, Home screen, Menu, unlike iPhone with only one button. quite inconvenient ??. That's why I decided to buy a new Wiko rather than an old iPhone with that money. However, it was not until later when I had an iPhone that I saw a button is probably more than enough for me, swiping right to return is sometimes faster than pressing the back button on Android. But let's compare Android and IOS to another article later.

Back to the Wiko phone. At that time, I was probably a young person who had an early access to the phone because when I bought it in Mobile World, the employee praised me for being able to use the phone early (He he he, also because I decided please ask to buy it until the end, ignoring dad's warnings). According to the specifications on the network, this phone has 1GB RAM, using MediaTek MT6582 chip, 10MP Camera After 5MP front, 16GB internal memory, expandable SD memory card up to 64GB, 5 inch IPS panel . However, the first impression when I held this product in hand when the staff opened it was that it looked bigger than I thought because the price was quite cheap.

The downside of this one is a lot. It has been 3 years since I bought the device and it still works and I gave it to my classmate.

##### And here are my honest experiences about this product:

* Stupid configuration, Facebook surfing is also laggy
* Bottle battery is pretty much due to 3 years of use. I estimate it can only use 1.5 hours if surfing the web normally
* The screen is pockmarked because of the low pixel, plus the touch effect, there is no need to argue about its recoil and chaos
* Camera dim in low light conditions. However, oranges in front of a wide angle are beautiful. I think that due to its wide angle, the light gains a lot of time &rarr; more beautiful than the back
* The community used at home and abroad has resulted in fewer self-help documentation installing Android ROM
* Accessories like case cover, toughness for this machine are extremely rare. The screen is fragile and scratched
* Poor finishing, machine made of plastic, the back cover can be disassembled, so now peeling quite a lot
* The touch navigation key is broken, so I have to root the device to turn on the virtual navigation key in the screen

And that's all my feeling about this product. How do you feel? Don't forget to leave a few words in the comments at the end of the article. Thank you!
