**Imagine, in your hands, a fixed phone instead of a smartphone that almost everyone now has. How will our life change?**

- Bring a paper map wherever you go instead of GPS.  
- Camera will be the main tool to capture the beautiful moments in each trip.  
- The whole family scrambled over the landline to talk.  
- Must open the computer to be able to check mail, look up information ...  

If life does not have a smartphone:  

- Most of us will remember more numbers of friends and relatives.  
- Enjoy a beautiful view, a concert, a play with your eyes completely instead of focusing on shooting, shooting or covering your view because hundreds of phones are raised.  
- Meetings with friends and family will be more complete.  
- Meet face to face, chat more directly.  


Landline phones - even its name suggests that you need to be able to use them instead of a mobile phone with you around.

Smartphones with their original purpose are to "connect". But nowadays, we can do everything by phone, except "face to face".

Smartphones help us to "operate": reading books, chatting, learning English, learning piano, gardening, ... just by swiping the screen. The way we manipulate people is completely changed when we rely too much on smartphones.

Smartphones let people "know a lot about the world" based on the information gathered, but actually they "know very little even about the space around them".

According to Apple's survey, users pull out their phone and use it 80 times a day. This figure reaches the milestone nearly 30,000 times a year. The phone seems to become an inseparable "friend" of man. Bill Gates - former Microsoft director does not allow children to contact smartphones or any electronic devices until they turn 14 years old.

Steve Jobs - co-founder, chairman, former CEO of Apple banned his son the use of iPad and other Apple devices.


Studies have shown that high school students' depression and suicidal risk increase to 27% when they use their phones more than 3 hours a day.

Young people, face up, focus on what's in front of you rather than looking down on your phone screen. Do not become increasingly stupid with a smartphone. Traveling, sightseeing, dating, take care of each other, work, please complete the mission ... Although we have two hands, I believe you cannot hold a mobile phone and the hands of others at the same time.
